        "In this assignment, you will:\n",
        "- Load the Airbnb dataset you cleaned in Assignment 6\n",
        "- Apply data transformation techniques like scaling, binning, encoding, and feature creation\n",
        "- Make the dataset easier to use for tasks like pricing analysis, guest segmentation, or listing recommendations\n",
        "- Practice writing up your analysis clearly so a business audience — like a host, marketing manager, or city partner — could understand it\n",

        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Airbnb analysts, hosts, and city partners rely on clean and well-structured data to make smart decisions. Whether they’re adjusting prices, identifying high-performing listings, or designing better guest experiences, they need data that’s transformed, organized, and ready for use.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Each row represents one property listing. The columns include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Host attributes** (e.g., host ID, host name, host response time)\n",
        "- **Listing details** (e.g., price, room type, minimum nights, availability)\n",
        "- **Location data** (e.g., neighborhood, latitude/longitude)\n",

        "- **Calendar/booking variables** (e.g., last review date, number of reviews)\n",

        "1. I examined the reviews_per_month. It shows how often listings recieve reviews and is right-skewed. This means most listings recieve few reviews per month with a few get many reviews per month.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. I applied a logarithmic transformation as it compresses big values while also keeping smaller ones interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Before the transformation the histogram showed a sharp peak near zero and has a long tail making it hard to identify meaningful variation. After the logarithmic transformation, the distribution is easier to visualize as its more symmetric. Overall I made the data more easy to interpret and suitable for regression and other statistical/analytical techniques down the road."
